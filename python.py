# Python got his name not from the snake, but from Monty Python's Flying Circus,
# a favorite comedy series
# of Guido van Rossum, the creator of Python

# Python is mainly used for automation purposes, web apps, and data science. Many big companies like Instagram,
# Facebook, and Amazon use Python in different parts of their products. For example, Facebook uses Python to process
# images.

# Python comes pre-installed on Linux and Mac operating systems. In May 2019, Windows 10 also launched an update
# which also have Python pre-installed. That is an added endorsement for Python.

print(my_date)
# you can also print in a single line too
